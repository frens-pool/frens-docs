# What is Frens?

### FRENS is a single-validator-staking-pool as a service.

## What does that mean?
- Easily deploy your own staking pool and invite your frens.
- Pool depositors recieve NFTs representing their stake in the pool.
- This NFT allows them to claim their share of the staking rewards from the pool, and to retrieve their initial deposit once the pool has been exited.
- The NFTs are transferable, so they can be sold on the open market if you need to exit your position quickly.

## Why Should I use FRENS?
- **Be the ethereum ambassador for your friends.** Run your node and welcome stakes from friends so they don't need to delegate to an anonymous entity.
- **Earn rewards and operator reputation.** More delegations means more rewards. Perform well and get a chance to get even more delegations.
- **DVT for peace of mind.** Avoid getting slashed by using SSVs distributed validator technology ... so u can always sleep well!
