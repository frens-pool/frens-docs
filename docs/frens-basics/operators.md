# Operators

## What is an operator?
- Operators run validators as a service.
- Using distributed validtor technology, your key is split, so you can give a key-share to each of four different operators.
- 3 operators must agree in order to sign a block.
- This makes it very difficult to get sashed, and as long as 3 of the 4 are online, your validator will run normally.

## How do I choose my operators?
- On the "select Your Oprators" page on the FRENS site, the 30 day performance of various operators is shown.
- If you click on "details" it will take you to the SSV site, which will show more information for that operator.
- Check the box next to the operators of your choice.
- Click "Next".

## What does it mean to split keyshare?
- This takes the signing key for your validator and splits it into 4 parts for the 4 operators (like some kind of cryptographic magic).
- Drop your keystore file (keystore-m_XXXXX.json) into the field, and click next.
